# Restaurant Recommendation & Classification Project

Welcome to the **Restaurant Recommendation & Classification** project! This project provides machine learning-based restaurant recommendations, cuisine classification, and geographical analysis of restaurants. It consists of three main tasks:

1. **Restaurant Recommendation** using cosine similarity based on user preferences.
2. **Cuisine Classification** using machine learning to predict restaurant cuisines.
3. **Location-Based Analysis** for visualizing restaurant locations on a map and analyzing geographic patterns.

## Project Overview

### **Task 1: Restaurant Recommendation**
The goal of this task is to recommend restaurants based on a user’s preferences (e.g., cuisine type, cost, and rating). We use cosine similarity to measure the similarity between user preferences and restaurant attributes.

**Steps:**
- Preprocess the dataset and filter restaurants based on certain criteria.
- Compute cosine similarity between user preferences and restaurant data.
- Recommend the most similar restaurants.

### **Task 2: Cuisine Classification**
In this task, we develop a machine learning model to classify restaurants based on their cuisine types. We use various classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to train the model and predict the cuisine.

**Steps:**
- Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Select a classification algorithm and train the model on the training data.
- Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

### **Task 3: Location-Based Analysis**
This task involves performing geographical analysis of restaurants by visualizing their locations on a map and analyzing the concentration of restaurants in various cities or localities.

**Steps:**
- Visualize the distribution of restaurant locations on an interactive map.
- Group restaurants by city/locality and analyze the concentration in different areas.
- Calculate statistics such as average ratings, cuisines, or price ranges by city or locality.
